## Executable Program

I can create a program that check currency rate online and calculate in real-time:

36.62
```

## Create your first program

Create a file called `helloworld.py`

```Python
print('Hello World')
```

And then run it:

```Bash

- Use keyword as folder name
  - e.g.: `for.py`, `array.py` or `function.py`
  - Eaiser to find the file next time.
- Or just use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
